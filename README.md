## Introduction

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/main_figure.png" alt="dreamcatalyst_main_figure"/>
</div>


DreamCatalyst is a novel framework that considers the sampling dynamics of diffusion models in the SDS(Score Distillation Sampling) framework. DreamCatalyst can be applied to various models in 3D editing, such as **NeRF** and **3DGS**. This method aims to reduce training time and improve editing quality. Please refer to the paper for more details.

<br/>

## Get Started

We provide the implementation of DreamCatalyst based on the both [NerfStudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio) and [Threestudio](https://github.com/threestudio-project/threestudio) frameworks. Nerfstudio is a framework for <b>NeRF or 3DGS editing</b>. Threestudio is a framework for <b>Gaussian Editor with DreamCatalyst</b>. Please refer to the following instructions.


### Dataset

Please download the dataset from the following link and extract it to the `dataset` directory.

- PDS provides image data for 3D scene. Please download the dataset [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtxL_EOxFeYMk3rftsoc4L8cg0VS?e=Hhbprk). 
This dataset includes 3D scene data from [Instruct-NeRF2NeRF](https://instruct-nerf2nerf.github.io/) as a subset. 
- You do not need to download Dreambooth checkpoints since our method does not require them.

<br/>

For using Threestudio (GaussianEditor), please follow the instruction below and extract the preprocessed COLMAP datasets and source 3DGS in the `colmap` and `scene` directory.

- We provide the COLMAP and intialized 3DGS for source scene. 
    - [COLMAP](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiR9dYaccIf8gawXADT9x7Trozy-pw?e=TS3V4l)
    - [Source 3DGS](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiR9dYaccIf8gawW1taPDyVtsUMUFA?e=3Q6Z2v)
- You can use the [dataset](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtxL_EOxFeYMk3rftsoc4L8cg0VS?e=Hhbprk) provided by PDS mentioned above.
    - Preprocess Dataset: you can follow the instruction of converting the dataset into COLMAP as [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting#processing-your-own-scenes).
    - Initialize 3DGS: please follow the instruction of initializing the 3DGS as [3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting#evaluation). you can find the point cloud `.ply` file. (e.g., `scene/yuseung/point_cloud/iteration_30000/point_cloud.ply`)
